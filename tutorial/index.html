    <title>Go Reactive with Java 8 & Play Framework</title>

<body>

<div>
    <p>You've just created a simple Play Framework application! Now lets explore the code and make some changes.</p>

    <h2>View the App</h2>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        To see how HTTP verbs and paths are mapped to controllers that handle the requests check out the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">conf/routes</a> file.  The single controller class for this application is defined in the <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.java" class="shortcut">app/controllers/Application.java</a> file.
    </p>

    <h2>Reactive Requests</h2>

    <p>
        A regular controller method in Play takes request and returns a response, like:
        <pre><code>public static Result syncFoo() {
    return ok("sync foo");
}</code></pre>
        Underneath the covers Play is implementing this in a async &amp; non-blocking way, meaning threads in a waiting state can be reclaimed and used for something else.  This differs from the usual Java servlet model where each open connection must have a thread.
        But this simple controller method doesn't have anything asynchronous about it.  There is no reason to be asynchronous unless you can also be non-blocking so you don't have to add extra async boilerplate code to your controllers unless there is something to not block on.  If you did want to do this same thing asynchronously using Java 8's Lambdas it would look like:
        <pre><code>public static F.Promise&lt;Result&gt; asyncFoo() {
    return F.Promise.promise(() -> ok("async foo"));
}</code></pre>
        Instead of returning a <code>Result</code> this controller method returns a handle to something that will in the future return the result.  In Play's Java API this is a <code>Promise</code>.  This now allows an event to trigger the response and in the meantime the thread used for handling this request can be reclaimed.  This controller method constructs a <code>Promise</code> that immediately is completed with a value, the <code>Result</code>.  The controller is now asynchronous but it still isn't non-blocking because it has nothing to not block on.
        A simple example of non-blocking is to set a delay or callback to happen after some amount of time.  Here is an example of that:
        <pre><code>public static F.Promise&lt;Result&gt; asyncNonBlockingFoo() {
    return F.Promise.delayed(() -> ok("async non-blocking foo"), 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
}</code></pre>
        When a request comes into this controller method the method will immediately return the <code>Promise</code>.  Now Play can un-block a thread.  During the 5 second delay there won't be any threads used for the request.  <a href="http://localhost:9000/async-non-blocking-foo" target="_blank">Try this request in your browser</a>.  You will notice that your browser loading indicator spins for 5 seconds but even though there was an open connection to the server for the request, most of the time no threads were being used to handle the request.
    </p>

    <h2>Reactive Composition</h2>

    <p>
        Artificial delays are a simple place to not-block but aren't are very usual.  A more practical place to not-block is when an incoming request must fetch some remote data in order to fulfill the request.  Here is an example that does just that:
        <pre><code>public static F.Promise&lt;Result&gt; reactiveRequest() {
    F.Promise&lt;WS.Response&gt; typesafePromise = WS.url("http://www.typesafe.com").get();
    return typesafePromise.map(response -> ok(response.getBody()));
}</code></pre>
        The controller method returns a <code>Promise</code> so it is asynchronous.  Inside the controller method a web client request is made to <code>www.typesafe.com</code> which is async &amp; non-blocking.  It returns a <code>Promise&lt;WS.Response&gt;</code> but the controller method must return a <code>Promise&lt;Result&gt;</code>.  The <code>WS.Response</code> is essentially the read side of a web response and the <code>Result</code> is the write side.  When the response comes back from <code>www.typesafe.com</code> we need to transform the <code>WS.Response</code> into a <code>Result</code>.  The <code>map</code> method on the <code>Promise</code> allows us to do exactly that.  When the response comes back the Lambda function is executed on the response, which in this case creates the <code>Result</code> containing just the response body.  <a href="http://localhost:9000/reactive-request" target="_blank">Try it out in your browser</a>.
        Note: You will notice that since we didn't set the content type the response is just plain text.  Usually we'd be working with JSON or other data formats instead of HTML pages.
        There were two requests, both of which were async &amp; non-blocking; the request from your browser to the Play app and the request from the Play app to <code>www.typesafe.com</code>.  Each of these requests was not using a thread when it was waiting for the other side to respond.  This is called <em>Reactive Composition</em>.  There was some point of time when we were just waiting for <code>www.typesafe.com</code> to respond, during which no threads were being used to handle this request.  But as soon as the response came back from <code>www.typesafe.com</code>, the <code>typesafePromise</code> was completed, then the <code>Response</code> was transformed into <code>Result</code> and the controller method's Promise was completed, thus sending the response back to the user.
        This gets more exciting when a web request composes together more than one async &amp non-blocking service in order to produce a result.  Here is an example of a controller method that makes two web requests:
        <pre><code>public static F.Promise&lt;Result&gt; reactiveComposition() {
    final F.Promise&lt;WS.Response&gt; twitterPromise = WS.url("http://www.twitter.com").get();
    final F.Promise&lt;WS.Response&gt; typesafePromise = WS.url("http://www.typesafe.com").get();

    return twitterPromise.flatMap((twitter) ->
            typesafePromise.map((typesafe) ->
                    ok(twitter.getBody() + typesafe.getBody())));
}</code></pre>
        In this case an incoming request needs to compose together responses from <code>www.twitter.com</code> and <code>www.typesafe.com</code>.  One way to get the responses from both requests in a async &amp; non-blocking way is to call <code>flatMap</code> on one, then inside that Lambda function, call <code>map</code> on the other.  The reason for the <code>flatMap</code> is it's Lambda function takes a response but returns a <code>Promise&lt;Result&gt;</code> instead of just a <code>Result</code>.  Using a <code>map</code> in this way would result in a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Result&gt;&gt;</code> and we really just a <code>Promise&lt;Result&gt;</code> so we <code>flatten</code> them.  (Note: <code>flatMap</code> is really a <code>map</code> and a <code>flatten</code> together.)
        <a href="http://localhost:9000/reactive-composition" target="_blank">Try this example out in your browser</a>.
        Now three requests are chained together and are all async &amp; non-blocking.  So there is some amount of time when we are waiting on either <code>www.twitter.com</code> and <code>www.typesafe.com</code> and no threads are being used for the user's request.
    </p>

    <h2>Reactive Push</h2>
    
    <p>
        Not only can typical web requests be async &amp; non-blocking but this same foundation can be used for doing Reactive Push from the server to the client.  Play supports three different ways to do this which have varying browser support: Comet, Server Sent Events, and WebSockets.  WebSockets in unique because it supports bi-directional Reactive Push so the client can also push messages to the server.
        Here is an example controller method that sets up the Server Sent Event channel (also known as <code>EventSource</code>) and sends a message when the browser connects to that channel:
        <pre><code>public static Result events() {
    EventSource eventSource = new EventSource() {
        public void onConnected() {
            sendData("hello");
        }
    };
    return ok(eventSource);
}</code></pre>
        Note: This example doesn't yet take advantage of Lambdas but it will be able to in the upcoming Play 2.3 release.  Also in most cases these messages would be JSON but this simple example just sends a string.
        You can find the client-side code for this example (written in CoffeeScript) in the <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee" class="shortcut">app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee</a> file.
        Once created the <code>eventSource</code> object can be used to send messages to the client whenever your applications wants to push a message.  The only time a thread is used for this push connection is when a message is being sent.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WebSockets provide a way to do bi-directional push.  In Play this is done async &amp; non-blocking like everything else.  Here is a controller method that creates the WebSocket:
        <pre><code>public static WebSocket&lt;String&gt; echo() {
    return new WebSocket&lt;String&gt;() {
        public void onReady(final In&lt;String&gt; in, final Out&lt;String&gt; out) {
            in.onMessage(out::write);
        }
    };
}</code></pre>
        In this case the WebSocket has a <code>onMessage</code> handler for when the client sends a message to the server.  This uses a Java 8 method handle to simply send that message back down to the client.  Check out the <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee" class="shortcut">app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee</a> file to see the client-side of this example.
